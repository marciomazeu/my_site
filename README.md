# my_site
Hi. This is my personal project to show some of my skills and to introduce myself as a developer.

I like to work as a web developer and make interesting applications.

I've already worked for an E-commerce company and a governmental institute developing web sites and health systems in Brazil.

In those projects I've used C#, .NET, Javascript, JQuery, SQL Oracle, Bootstrap and sometimes Ionic/Angular to develop some apps.

I hope to show you more in detail about my experience and skills on this website.

Thanks for visiting.
